      <h3> Humidity Sensing Low Cost Passive Chipless RFID Tag </h3>
      <p> Group design project. The goal was to design a radio-frequency identification device that is easy
          to manufacture (low cost), with no internal power source (passive), that does not require a microchip (chipless),
          and that can detect changes in humidity. </p>
      <p> The first picture shows our experimental results for different
          levels of humidity. Our design process is illustrated by the second picture. The third picture is a high level
          block diagram of the system.</p>
